Program:

  
 
# Start MongoDB

# Create and select the database
use CompanyDatabase

# Create and insert documents into the 'projects' collection (5 records)
db.projects.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "Project Alpha", project_type: "Software", duration: 6 },
  { _id: 2, name: "Project Beta", project_type: "Hardware", duration: 4 },
  { _id: 3, name: "Project Gamma", project_type: "Software", duration: 2 },
  { _id: 4, name: "Project Delta", project_type: "Software", duration: 8 },
  { _id: 5, name: "Project Epsilon", project_type: "Hardware", duration: 3 }
])

# Create and insert documents into the 'employees' collection (5 records)
db.employees.insertMany([

  { _id: 4, name: "Mr. Mhaske", project_ids: [1, 2] },
  { _id: 5, name: "Mr. Joshi", project_ids: [3, 4] }
])

# a. List all names of projects where Project_type = "Software"
db.projects.find({ project_type: "Software" }, { name: 1, _id: 0 })

# b. List all the projects with duration greater than 3 months
db.projects.find({ duration: { $gt: 3 } }, { name: 1, _id: 0 })

# c. Count the number of employees working on "Project Alpha"
db.employees.find({ project_ids: 1 }).count()

# d. List the names of projects on which Mr. Patil is working
db.employees.aggregate([
  { $match: { name: "Mr. Patil" } },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "projects",
      localField: "project_ids",
